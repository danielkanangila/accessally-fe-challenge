# ACCESSALLY CODING ASSESSMENT
## PROBLEM 1: FINDING FAVORITE TIMES
### SOLUTION:
The solution of this problem is in `arithmetic_sequence.py` file. The runtime complexity of this solution is `O(n)`.
**Note**: This code require `numpy==1.18.*`. I used numpy to check if the sequence of number is an arithmetic sequence.
## PROBLEM 2: BLOOD DISTRIBUTION
### SOLUTION:
The solution of this problem is in `blood_distribution.py` file. The runtime complexity of this solution is `O(n*n)`.

## Requirements:
'''
python=='3.*'
numpy=='1.18.5' # Required for the solution 1
'''
